                        <p>Sung Jinwoo (성진우, Seong Jin-Wu) is the main protagonist of Solo 
                            Leveling. He is the strongest hunter in the world and the second 
                            Shadow Monarch, having inherited the position from his predecessor 
                            Ashborn.

                            Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, Jinwoo got the chance of 
                            a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him
                            the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a result,
                            by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the 
                            System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter.

                    <p>Jinwoo is a tall, handsome, and muscular young man with gray 
                        eyes, sharp facial features, and black hair with bangs that 
                        dangle all the way down to his eyes. When using his powers or 
                        feeling intense emotions, his eyes glow purple and his facial 
                        features become more pronounced. He favors dark clothing and
                         often seen in sleek and stylish outfits ranging from tailored
                          suits to long hooded coats. After defeating the Monarchs in 
                          the revised timeline created by the Cup of Reincarnation, 
                          he also starts wearing a black glove on his left hand to 
                          cover up the burn scars that he received there during his 
                          rematch with Antares.

                        Before he was chosen as the Player of the System, Jinwoo had 
                        a very different appearance. He was shorter and had a 
                        noticeably thinner physique, with long, bushy hair that 
                        covered up his ears. His face was very boyish, which made 
                        him look even younger than his sister Jinah (who was still a 
                        teenager at the time), and he tended to dress in casual 
                        attire, favoring a simple blue hoodie and jeans. It was also 
                        common to see him wearing bandages on his arms and legs due 
                        to the frequent injuries that he received on raids.

                    Jinwoo is a humble and benevolent individual who cares deeply 
                    for his family and has an ardent desire to become stronger. As a 
                    result, he shares a close relationship with his sister and his 
                    mother, and rarely wastes an opportunity to refine his skills and 
                    gain more power. His deep bond with his family also makes him 
                    absolutely merciless towards anyone who dares to hurt them, as 
                    displayed when he massacred Groctar and his minions for attempting
                     to kill Jinah, and murdered Hwang Dongsoo for torturing Jinho.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted that despite being the strongest hunter in the 
                    world, Jinwoo is not particularly arrogant and is both polite and 
                    easygoing in-person. He is also mostly indifferent to 
                    materialistic desires and can be very selfless, as displayed 
                    when he teleported to Jeju Island without a second thought to 
                    save the other Korean S-Rank Hunters from certain death. In 
                    battle, however, he is ruthless, as he tends to slaughter his 
                    enemies indiscriminately, and even somewhat disdainful, as 
                    displayed when he taunted the Ant King by calling him a "mere 
                    insect" and mocked Kandiaru for the flaws he made in his design
                    of the System.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast, back when he was weak, Jinwoo was very timid and 
                    insecure due to his incompetence as a hunter and his troubled 
                    financial situation. Although he cared deeply for his family and 
                    spent years risking his life going on raids for their sake, he 
                    was secretly ashamed of his circumstances, as displayed when he 
                    lied to Joohee about why he had chosen hunting as his career path.
                     However, his traumatizing experience in the Double Dungeon would 
                     give him everything he needed to become stronger, and being 
                     betrayed and left to die by his fellow hunters while trapped 
                     inside the dungeon would teach him the harsh lesson that his 
                     kindness could be exploited by others for their own benefit. 
                     As a result, from that point on, Jinwoo vowed to never again 
                     recklessly endanger his own life under the guise of the greater 
                     good and adopted a more self-preserving stance as a hunter, 
                     primarily focusing on amassing strength and eventually growing 
                     into the fearsome warrior that he is today.
